This repository contains a Lua example demonstrating an uncommon error related to the handling of nil values in arithmetic operations.  The `bug.lua` file shows the problematic code, where a function expects numerical arguments but doesn't handle the case where one or both arguments are nil.  This can lead to silent failures or unexpected results.  The `bugSolution.lua` file provides a corrected version that handles nil values gracefully.
